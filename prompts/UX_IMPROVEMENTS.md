You are tasked with improving the design of a Node.js app using standard CSS frameworks and
approaches. Your goal is to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the application while
maintaining its functionality.

First, review the current Node.js app code in this repo.

Begin by analyzing the current design of the app. Identify areas that could be improved in terms of
layout, color scheme, typography, and overall user interface.

Next, consider incorporating a standard CSS framework such as Bootstrap, Bulma, or Tailwind CSS.
Choose the framework that best suits the needs of this particular app. If a framework is already in
use, consider updating it to the latest version or switching to a more appropriate one.

Improve the following design elements:

1. Layout: Ensure a responsive and mobile-friendly design.
2. Color scheme: Choose a cohesive and visually appealing color palette.
3. Typography: Select appropriate fonts and sizes for better readability.
4. Spacing and alignment: Improve the overall balance and visual hierarchy.
5. UI components: Enhance buttons, forms, and other interactive elements.
6. Consistency: Ensure a uniform look and feel throughout the app.

Based on your analysis, modify the Node.js app code to implement the design improvements. Include
any necessary CSS framework imports, custom CSS, and HTML structure changes.
